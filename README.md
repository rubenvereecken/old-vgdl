# PyVGDL
## VGDL 2.0 is now out!
[VGDL 2.0](https://github.com/rubenvereecken/py-vgdl)
is an actively supported,
brand new implementation that remains backward compatible.
It is a full-fledged library
with a focus on extensibility,
support for model-based approaches,
human play and replay.
Plus it interfaces with OpenAI Gym
for incredible ease of use.
This new incarnation is recommended for anyone looking
to start using VGDL today.

## VGDL 1 Description
PyVGDL is a high-level video game description language (VGDL) built on top of pygame.

The aim is to decompose game descriptions into two parts: 1) a very high-level description, close to human language, to specify the dynamics, which builds on 2) an ontology of preprogrammed concepts for dynamics, interactions, control.
Programmers extend the possibilities of (1) by writing modules in (2), and game designers can very quickly compose new games from those components without programming.


## References

The original idea was [discussed in the 2012 Dagstuhl seminar](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2013/4338/pdf/9.pdf),
with a [full description](http://www.idsia.ch/~tom/publications/pyvgdl.pdf) presented at the IEEE CIG conference 2013 (this is also
the reference paper to [cite](http://www.idsia.ch/~tom/bibtex/pyvgdl.bib) if you use PyVGDL for academic work).

## Installation and Dependencies


### Dependencies
*  Get the [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) package
* (Alternative Method) Using Homebrew and virtualenv on Mac OSX

            brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi
            pip install mercurial
            pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

*  For all reinforcement learning usage, also get the [PyBrain](http://www.pybrain.org) machine learning library

*  For the upload to youtube functionality, you will need the [gdata](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gdata) library
